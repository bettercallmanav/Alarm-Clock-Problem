# 1940s Blind-Accessible Talking Alarm Clock

An interactive simulation of a historically-inspired design for a blind-accessible alarm clock from the 1940s. This project showcases how phonograph technology could have been adapted to create an accessible timepiece that announced the time audibly and provided tactile feedback for blind users.

## üîç Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive exploration of assistive technology in a historical context:

- **Problem Statement**: Documents the challenges blind individuals faced with timekeeping in the 1940s
- **Interactive Simulation**: Functional web-based simulation with audio feedback
- **Technical Solution**: Detailed explanation of the mechanical design and components

## üéØ Features

- **Time Announcement**: Click a button to hear the current time spoken
- **Interactive Controls**: Set the time and alarm with intuitive controls
- **Alarm Functionality**: Set and trigger alarms with audio feedback
- **Historical Context**: Learn how this would have worked with 1940s technology
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion
- Web Audio API
- SVG for mechanical illustrations

## üìù Historical Note

This project demonstrates how accessibility could have been achieved with mechanical technology in the 1940s, before digital electronics were available. The audio simulation uses Web Audio API to mimic the characteristic sound of phonograph recordings from that era.
